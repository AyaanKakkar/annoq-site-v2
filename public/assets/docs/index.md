# AnnoQ Help/Tutorial

AnnoQ is a platform that integrates a datastore of pre-annotated SNPs, APIs and packages for accessing the SNPs programmatically and a website for viewing the SNP data. The backend of the system is a large collection of pre-annotated variants from [TopMed](https://topmed.nhlbi.nih.gov/): a program of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI), a part of the National Institutes of Health.  The data from TopMed is from version [Freeze 8](https://legacy.bravo.sph.umich.edu/freeze8/hg38/), which has more than 700 million SNPs with sequence features by [WGSA](https://sites.google.com/site/jpopgen/wgsa) and functions by [PANTHER](https://pantherdb.org), [Gene Ontology](https://geneontology.org/), [Reactome](https://reactome.org/) and [PEREGRINE](https://www.peregrineproj.org/) enhancer mappings. Variants mapped to the [Haplotype Reference Consortium](http://www.haplotype-reference-consortium.org/) r1.1 panel can be queried as a subset using the **Search HRC data** option, which reports hg19 coordinates. The annotations have also been [categorized](/detail) to allow users easy access to specific subsets of data. The data can be accessed via [API](/docs/services/api).

[AnnoQ Tutorials](/docs/tutorials) gives a high-level overview of the system with details about the [Interactive Query UI](/search), [API](/docs/services/api), and software packages for programmatic access.

 **This website is free and open to all users and there is no login requirement.**

## What can you do with AnnoQ?
Access large scale genetic variant annotations
  - [Interactive Query UI](/search): Retrieve and or view annotation data using a graphical user interface on standard web browsers.
    - Search for SNPs using uing:
      - Genome Coordinates
      - VCF file upload
      - Gene Product
      - rsID
    - Download search results formatted as:
      - csv file
      - tsv file
    - Export configuration file with search fields of interest to use with the API, or for future searches or sharing

  - [AnnoQ Services](/docs/services/): Retrieve annotation data from the command line or scripts.
  
  - [R Package](/docs/tutorials/r-package): Retrieve annotation data via the R programming language.

  - [Python Library](/docs/tutorials/annoq-py): Retrieve annotation data using the Python programming language.
